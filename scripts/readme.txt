-- bom-in-python --
This directory contains the python BOM generator scripts from the Kicad source repo.
Much better BOM generation with these than the built-in XSLT scripts. (as of 4.0rc2)
Point Kicad's BOM dialog to this directory.

Customize some files - primarily kicad_netlist_reader.py to do what you want.
Favorite formatter is bom_csv_grouped_by_value.py.
